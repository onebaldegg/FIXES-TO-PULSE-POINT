The trajectory details the development of a Brand Watch AI tool for PR and marketing firms. Initially, the user requested an MVP focusing on basic sentiment analysis, text input, and pre-built APIs. The AI engineer, using the  and , established an OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) integration. The core application was built using  for FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, featuring a modern UI with images from . After successful MVP testing, the user requested sequential feature enhancements. Emotion detection, integrating 8 Plutchik emotions, was implemented by updating LLM prompts, data models, and the frontend display. A significant design change introduced a Matrix-themed video background with a complementary green aesthetic. Subsequently, sarcasm detection was added, providing adjusted sentiment and visual indicators. Most recently, topic/thematic analysis was integrated, allowing the detection and display of multiple business topics with confidence scores. Each feature was thoroughly planned, implemented through backend and frontend updates, and validated via screenshots and a . The work flow demonstrates iterative development, rigorous testing, and strong adherence to UI/UX guidelines and technical constraints.

<product_requirements>
The Brand Watch AI tool aims to provide PR and marketing professionals with advanced sentiment analysis, crisis management, competitor benchmarking, campaign ROI, and consumer behavior insights. The initial MVP focused on:
1.  **Basic Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.
2.  **Text Input**: Manual text submission for analysis.
3.  **Pre-built APIs**: Utilizing services like OpenAI or Google Cloud NL for faster MVP development.

Subsequent features implemented include:
-   **Emotion Detection**: Identifying 8 specific emotions (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Trust, Disgust, Surprise, Anticipation) with confidence scores, displayed prominently in the UI and history.
-   **Matrix-Themed Design**: A unique aesthetic featuring a looping Matrix-style digital rain video background, complemented by a professional green color scheme, glass-morphism effects, and consistent branding.
-   **Sarcasm Detection**: Identifying ironic or sarcastic language, providing an adjusted sentiment where sarcasm flips the true meaning, and visually highlighting sarcasm with confidence scores.
-   **Topic/Thematic Analysis**: Automatically categorizing discussion topics within text (e.g., Customer Service, Product Quality, Pricing) with relevance scores, a primary topic indicator, and color-coded visual tags.
The application includes a two-panel layout for input/results and analysis history, with data persistence in MongoDB.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: FastAPI (backend), React (frontend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI Integration**: Emergent LLM (GPT-4o-mini) for sentiment, emotion, sarcasm, and topic detection.
-   **UI/UX Framework**: Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI for modern, responsive design.
-   **Containerization**: Application runs within a Kubernetes environment.
-   **Environment Management**: Strict use of  variables (REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL, MONGO_URL).
-   **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Crafting detailed prompts for structured JSON responses.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, leveraging MongoDB for data storage.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, defining FastAPI routes, interacting with MongoDB, and orchestrating AI sentiment analysis. It uses Pydantic for request/response models and  for async MongoDB operations. It handles LLM calls for multi-faceted text analysis.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup for basic sentiment analysis.
        -   Integrated  library for  LLM.
        -   Added  environment variable.
        -   Modified  Pydantic model to include  (list of dictionaries with emotion, confidence), , , , , , ,  (list of dictionaries with topic, display_name, confidence, keywords), , and .
        -   Updated the  to instruct GPT-4o-mini to return structured JSON containing sentiment, emotions, sarcasm details, and detected topics.
        -   The  endpoint was enhanced to process the LLM response for all these new fields and store them in MongoDB.
        -   CORS handling and database connection via  are maintained.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component rendering the entire application UI. It manages application state, makes API calls to the backend, and displays analysis results and history.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial scaffold for a two-panel layout, input form, and history display.
        -   Added state management for emotion, sarcasm, and topic data.
        -   Integrated  element with the Matrix-style background video ().
        -   Implemented UI components to display emotion badges (color-coded, with confidence), sarcasm warnings (orange badge, adjusted sentiment), and topic tags (color-coded, with primary topic and summary).
        -   Updated the analysis history section to reflect new emotion, sarcasm, and topic data in each entry.
        -   Ensured responsive design and professional UI/UX, adhering to Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS guidelines.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines global styles, Tailwind CSS directives, and custom CSS for specific UI enhancements, including the Matrix theme.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial Tailwind CSS setup.
        -   Added styles for the video background (fixed position, z-index, blur, dimming overlay) to ensure content readability.
        -   Defined custom utility classes for the green Matrix theme, glass-morphism effects (backdrop-filter blur, semi-transparent backgrounds), and color palettes for emotions (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Trust, Disgust, Surprise, Anticipation), sarcasm (orange), and topics (Customer Service, Product Quality, Pricing, etc.).
        -   Ensured hover states and micro-animations for interactive elements.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for the backend, critically  and .
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  for LLM API access.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  (and potentially  if not already present, though  was explicitly mentioned).

The architecture focuses on a modular approach, where each new AI analysis feature (emotion, sarcasm, topics) is integrated by extending existing data models, modifying a single LLM prompt, and updating UI components, rather than creating separate API calls or complex logic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented and thoroughly tested the **Topic/Thematic Analysis** feature. This enhancement allows the Brand Watch AI tool to automatically identify and categorize discussion topics within text, such as Customer Service, Product Quality, or Pricing.

The current state of the application is a highly advanced sentiment analysis tool with comprehensive AI capabilities:
1.  **Sentiment Classification**: Positive, Negative, Neutral.
2.  **Emotion Detection**: Identifies 8 core emotions (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Trust, Disgust, Surprise, Anticipation) with confidence scores.
3.  **Sarcasm Detection**: Identifies sarcastic language, provides a confidence score, explains the sarcasm, and offers an adjusted sentiment if sarcasm flips the original meaning.
4.  **Topic/Thematic Analysis**: Detects multiple discussion topics within a text, assigns confidence scores, identifies a primary topic, and provides an AI-generated topic summary.

Visually, the application features a unique **Matrix-themed design** with a looping digital rain video background, professional green gradients and accents, and glass-morphism UI elements that ensure readability over the dynamic background. The UI effectively displays all these analysis results through color-coded badges, confidence percentages, and detailed explanations, both for the current analysis and in the historical record. The backend, powered by FastAPI and MongoDB, efficiently handles the complex LLM (GPT-4o-mini) calls, processing all these analysis types in a single request and persisting the rich data.
