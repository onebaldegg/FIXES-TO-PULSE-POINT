The AI engineer successfully guided the Brand Watch AI application from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. Initially, the project established a FastAPI, React, and MongoDB stack with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for basic sentiment analysis. Subsequent iterations introduced sophisticated features: emotion detection, a unique Matrix-themed UI, sarcasm detection, topic/thematic analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-format file upload, and comprehensive URL analysis using  and usage: pdfplumber [-h] [--structure | --structure-text]

  --indent INDENT       Indent level for JSON pretty-printing.. Each feature involved backend and frontend development, rigorous testing, and UI/UX adherence. Most recently, a robust OAuth 2.0 authentication system with JWT, bcrypt, email verification, and password reset was implemented backend-side, and the frontend UI for this was built. The current focus is on debugging critical frontend issues with the user dashboard modal and logout functionality. The development process highlighted a strong emphasis on user feedback, iterative enhancements, and systematic problem-solving, including bug fixes for PDF extraction and test logic.

<product_requirements>
The Brand Watch AI tool assists PR and marketing professionals with advanced sentiment analysis, crisis management, and market insights. The initial MVP delivered basic sentiment analysis from text input using pre-built AI APIs. Currently, the application provides:
-   **Multi-faceted AI Analysis**: Basic sentiment, 8 Plutchik emotions, sarcasm detection with adjusted sentiment, topic/thematic analysis, and aspect-based sentiment analysis.
-   **Diverse Input Methods**: Manual text, batch file upload (TXT, CSV, Excel, PDF), and URL analysis (single or batch).
-   **User Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 based registration, login, password reset, and user-specific data persistence, including usage tracking for a freemium model.
-   **Themed UI**: A unique Matrix-style digital rain video background, professional green and blue/cyan accents, and glass-morphism effects across a two-panel (input/results & history) or three-tab (text/file/URL analysis) layout.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the backend and most of the frontend implementation for the **User Accounts & Authentication** feature. The backend's OAuth 2.0 system is fully functional, supporting user registration (with PRO tier for test users), JWT token-based login, password hashing (bcrypt), email verification, and password reset. It also enforces protected API endpoints and tracks basic usage metrics per user.

On the frontend, the AI engineer successfully integrated the authentication context, built a Matrix-themed login/registration modal, and added a user menu in the header with basic account information. However, during the final frontend testing, two critical bugs were identified:
1.  The **dashboard modal is not opening** when triggered from the user menu.
2.  The **sign-out button does not function**, preventing users from logging out.

The AI engineer is currently in the debugging phase for these specific frontend issues, researching proven methods for React modal implementation and authentication state management to systematically fix these problems as requested by the user. The testing credentials for PRO access are  with password .
